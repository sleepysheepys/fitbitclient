What is this?
=============

A simple java client for the Fitbit API (http://dev.fitbit.com/).

Why don't you just use *fitbit4j*?
==================================

Because I think the API is horrible and it hurts my brain to use it. I want a simple REST-like
API for my programming which doesn't get in the way of doing stuff.

I try to stay close to the REST API without doing too clever stuff for you.

This is missing method *XYZ*. Will you add it?
==============================================

Well, *fork this repository* and create it yourself. Or create an *Issue* and I will
try to implement it.
